# job-counter

## About This Project
You're sitting there, having just graduated your coding bootcamp. "Time to start applying for jobs!" After a few weeks a friend asks you,
"How many jobs have you applied to now?". In comes Job Counter! You respond to your friend, "Well thanks to the job counter app I made, I can tell you exactly how many! 
I have applied to 236!". Job Counter allows a user to tally up the jobs they've applied to through the click of a button. 

This is the first bit of Javascript code I have worked with :)! I have learned how to declare variables with "let", create functions, and
how to interact with the DOM and use syntax like "document.getElementByID()". Cheers to the Javascript journey!
